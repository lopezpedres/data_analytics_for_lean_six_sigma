This is a repo that contains all the theory and exercises from the Coursera
course 'Data Analytics for lean six sigma', with the exception that I'm trying
to do it all in python instead of Minitab.
I'm saving all the files in jupyter notebooks format (.ipynb), each files is named
under a excel sheet from the excel book called '_fb205379f16688a0d5fff594e91ac7e7_data_files_DA-LSS.xlsx'

All the exercises and examples belong to the author of the course
